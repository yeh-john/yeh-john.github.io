        <p class="about_art">Smartphone addiction is increasingly prevalent and can negatively impact mental and physical health, social connections, 
            and overall well-being. While smartphones offer benefits like increased connectivity and access to information, excessive use can interfere 
            with mental well-being, cause physical health problems, and lead to isolation. Developing healthier technology habits, such as setting screen
            time limits and prioritizing face-to-face interactions, is important to address this issue.</p>
